Docker Run command
 
This command is used to run a container from an image. The docker run command is a combination of the docker create and docker start commands. It creates a new container from the image specified and starts that container. if the docker image is not present, then the docker run pulls that.
 
$ docker run <image_name>
 To give name of container
 $ docker run --name <container_name> <image_name> 
Docker Pull 
This command allows you to pull any image which is present in the official registry of docker, Docker hub. By default, it pulls the latest image, but you can also mention the version of the image. 
$ docker pull <image_name> 
Docker PS
This command (by default) shows us a list of all the running containers. We can use various flags with it. 
• -a flag: shows us all the containers, stopped or running. 
• -l flag: shows us the latest container. 
• -q flag: shows only the Id of the containers. 
$ docker ps [options..] 
Docker Stop 
This command allows you to stop a container if it has crashed or you want to switch to another one. 
$ docker stop <container_ID> 
Docker Start 
Suppose you want to start the stopped container again, you can do it with the help of this command. $ docker start <container_ID>.     

Docker RM:
To delete a container. By default when a container is created, it gets an ID as well as an imaginary name such as confident_boyd, heuristic_villani, etc. You can either mention the container name or its ID. 
Some important flags: 
• -f flag: remove the container forcefully. 
• -v flag: remove the volumes. 
• -l flag: remove the specific link mentioned. 

$ docker rm {options} <container_name or ID> 

Docker RMI 
To delete the image in docker. You can delete the images which are useless from the docker local storage so you can free up the space
 
docker rmi <image ID/ image name> 

Docker Images
Lists all the pulled images which are present in our system. 
$ docker images
